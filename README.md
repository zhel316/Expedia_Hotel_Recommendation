# Expedia Personalized Hotel Recommendation System

Expedia is the world’s largest online travel agency (OTA) and powers search results for millions of travel shoppers every day. In this competitive market matching users to hotel inventory is very important since users easily jump from website to website. As such, having the best ranking of hotels (“sort”) for specific users with the best integration of price competitiveness gives an OTA the best chance of winning the sale.

The topic of this project is positioned in the area of recommender systems. More specifically, our task is to predict what hotel a user is most likely to book. This could greatly help companies such as Expedia (from which the dataset actually originates) to organize the search results for a user in the most suitable way.

This is our attempt to create accurate hotel recommendations for the Expedia website. For details and motivation behind our implementation refer to the file `Report.pdf`.
